**Business Problem**

<p align = "justify">
I will tackle the business problem of automating news article categorization into specific topics, namely "World," "Sports," "Business," and "Sci/Tech." This task is crucial for enhancing the efficiency and user experience of news platforms by streamlining content recommendation and ensuring that readers can easily access the information that interests them.
The task at hand involves developing a robust Natural Language Processing (NLP) model that can classify news articles into one of the four main categories, based on their content and context. This classification is vital for organizing and presenting news content effectively, as well as for delivering personalized news recommendations to users. By automating this process, news platforms can optimize content delivery, engage readers more effectively, and potentially increase user retention and satisfaction.</p>
